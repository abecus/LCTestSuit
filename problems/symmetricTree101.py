Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric
around its center). For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
is symmetric:      1    / \   2   2  / \ / \ 3  4 4  3    But the
following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:      1    / \   2   2    \  
\    3    3    Follow up: Solve it both recursively and iteratively.
