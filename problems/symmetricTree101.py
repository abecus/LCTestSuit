Given     a     binary     tree,     check    whether    it    is    a    mirror
of itself (ie, symmetric around its center). For                                

example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:    1   / \  2   2 / \ / \3  4 4  3     1   / \  2   2   \   \   3    3 Follow up: Solve it both recursively and iteratively.
